Class-Indexed version 0.01
==========================

An abstract class providing fine-grained and incremental-update fulltext
indexing for classes that inherit from it.

Class::Indexed is designed to provide most of the functionality described
in the article : 'Adding Search Functionality to Perl Applications'
( http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/09/25/searching.html ) and I recommend
you read it through to gain understanding of the code and principles
involved.
